# Some images already know what to do by default, but this image (paketobuildpacks/httpd) needs you to say exactly what to run.

# So, by giving this command, you are telling the container:

# "Hey, please start the Apache web server now!"

# Without this command, the container doesnâ€™t know what to do, so it fails to start.
